          <b>    Forests cover nearly one-third of the land area on our planet and are home to most of the world’s life on
            land. They are also essential to human health, purifying our water and air and serving as our first line of
            defense against new infectious diseases. Additionally, forests provide more than 86 million green jobs and
            resources such as food and fuel that support billions of people’s livelihoods. Forests also play a critical
            role in mitigating climate change because they act as carbon sinks—soaking up carbon dioxide that would
            otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contributing to ongoing changes in climate patterns.</b>

            <strong>    But forests across the globe are under threat, jeopardizing these benefits. The threats manifest themselves
            in the form of deforestation and forest degradation. The leading cause of deforestation is agriculture, with
            poorly planned infrastructure another significant contributor to global deforestation. In 2022, the world
            lost more than 16 million acres of forest—an area bigger than West Virginia—according to the 2023 Forest
            Declaration Assessment. The primary causes of forest degradation are logging activities, livestock grazing,
            and the construction of roads.</strong>

            <b>   Deforestation is a particular concern in tropical rain forests because these forests are home to much of the
            world’s biodiversity. In the Amazon alone, around 17% of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years,
            mainly due to forest conversion for cattle ranching. Deforestation in this region is especially rampant near
            more populated areas, roads, and rivers, but remote areas have also been encroached upon with the discovery
            of valuable resources like gold and oil.</b>
